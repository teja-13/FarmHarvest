Build a fully offline-capable web application for farmers and agricultural students that takes soil testing input and land area and suggests the best crops to grow, along with the full process from seed to harvest. The application should include a trained machine learning model for crop recommendation and a plant disease detection system using images (camera or upload). It must also provide a simple AI chatbot for answering queries about crop processes.

ðŸ’» Detailed Requirements
User Interface

Simple and clean UI

Signup and login page (multi-user support)

Dashboard after login

Inputs

Soil test values (N, P, K, pH, EC, S, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, B)

Land area

Option to upload a soil test file (CSV or JSON)

Output

Crop suggestions using a trained ML model

Full process for selected crop (from seed selection to fertilizers and harvesting)

Downloadable PDF of the suggested crop process

Disease Detection

Use device camera or uploaded image

Identify common crop diseases

Suggest remedies or medicines

AI Chatbot

Offline chatbot to answer questions related to crop growing processes

Use rule-based or keyword-matching techniques

ML Model

Train a simple machine learning model on mock or realistic soil data to predict suitable crops

Use scikit-learn or similar

Save as .pkl file for use in Flask backend

Storage

Use JSON files to store:

Crop growing processes

User data (optional)

No need for internet or external DB

Technology Stack
